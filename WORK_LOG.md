The gist was to create a 2D array that represented on the columns the letters of one string, and the rows the letters of the other string. If the letters matched during traversal, we would add 1 to the value saved in the spot diagonal to our current spot. If they didn't match, we would use the larger saved value between the spot above and to the right of the current string. We struggled with finding whether this was actually a correct algorithm to solve the pset or whether we just got lucky with a given case. |

What I do know is that the values I'm saving at a given point do prove the longest sequence to get to that given letter and that the way we're traversing it lets us look at previous spaces to find the previous max value and add to that. However, I can't fully find a way to prove our solution as foolproof, so I just started to try to code out what our concept was and passed all checks. I hope in class I can create a full proof that our solution will always work. |
| Feb 27 | 9-10:10:40am | In class today, I think I came up with a real reason as to why this solution truly works. Also, I was able to find the longest shared substring, not just the length. I'm not 100% sure that this is correct, but the lengths match. Now I'm working on how to find all of the longest Strings and we're currently thinking of more of a bottom-up recursive approach but it's super slow. We're trying to basically reverse what we currently have and go down paths with that approach, but are trying to figure out how to make it faster. We spent tutorial working through this problem too on the whiteboard. Now we're thinking of a top bottom approach that shows every possible substring that comes from a given spot on the array. We're trying to think of a data structure that lets us be clever with the data and be space efficient. |
